## Installation

### Step 1: Create a Python 3.9 Virtual Environment
First, ensure you have Python 3.9 installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

To create a virtual environment using Python 3.9, open your terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
# Install virtualenv if you haven't already
pip install virtualenv

# Create a virtual environment named 'env'
virtualenv -p python3.9 env
```
### Step 2: Activate the Virtual Environment
Activate the virtual environment using the appropriate command for your operating system:

- **For Windows:**
  ```bash
  .\env\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **For macOS and Linux:**
  ```bash
  source env/bin/activate
  ```
### Step 2: Activate the Virtual Environment
Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required dependencies by running:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
